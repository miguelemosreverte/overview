# Project Context and AI Workflow

## üîÑ UPGRADED: Now includes Valve Protocol for Monotonic Improvement

## Valve Protocol: Monotonic Code Improvement Workflow

### Overview
This document defines the Valve Protocol - a system ensuring that all code changes move KPIs forward, never backward. Like a one-way valve in engineering, changes can only flow in the direction of improvement.

### Core Principle
**Every code change must maintain or improve ALL existing metrics. Regressions are blocked at the system level.**

## Project KPIs and Baselines

### Current Metrics
- [ ] Test Coverage: _%
- [ ] Performance: _ms average
- [ ] Code Quality Score: _/100
- [ ] Test Count: _
- [ ] Build Time: _s
- [ ] Bundle Size: _KB

### Goals for This Session
- [ ] Primary Goal: 
- [ ] Secondary Goals:
  - [ ] 
  - [ ] 

### Completed Improvements
<!-- AI agents should update this section after each successful change -->

## Workflow Rules for AI Agents

### 1. Before Making Any Changes
- Read all existing documentation
- Check current test coverage
- Run existing tests to establish baseline
- Review recent commits for context

### 2. When Implementing Changes
Follow this strict order:
1. **Write tests first** (TDD approach)
2. **Implement minimal code** to pass tests
3. **Refactor** only if all metrics improve
4. **Document** changes in this file

### 3. Code Change Checklist
Before considering any change complete:
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests added for new functionality
- [ ] No performance regression
- [ ] Code follows project style guide
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

### 4. Continuous Improvement Rules
- **Small increments**: Make many small improvements rather than large changes
- **Test everything**: If it's not tested, it doesn't exist
- **Measure first**: Before optimizing, measure current state
- **Lock in gains**: Once improved, update baselines

## AI-Specific Instructions

### For Claude Code
- Use TodoWrite to track all tasks
- Consolidate project understanding in this file
- Run tests after every significant change
- Use --continue flag to maintain context across sessions

### For Gemini CLI
- Read this file first to understand project state
- Follow the same workflow as Claude
- Update metrics section after improvements
- Use checkpointing to save progress

## Session Management

### Starting a Session
```bash
# 1. Check project status
npm test
npm run lint

# 2. Review this document
cat CLAUDE.md

# 3. Set session goals (update Goals section above)
```

### During the Session
```bash
# Continuous validation
npm test -- --watch
npm run lint -- --watch

# Before each commit
npm test -- --coverage
npm run build
```

### Ending a Session
```bash
# 1. Run full test suite
npm test -- --coverage

# 2. Update metrics in this file

# 3. Commit with descriptive message
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: [description] - Coverage: X%, Tests: +N"
```
